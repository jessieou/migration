  <h2>About Data</h2>
 
    <p> 
    The data used comes from searchable tables provided by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data.html">US Census Bureau</a>, which collects data about every resident in the United States every 10 years. According to <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html#:~:text=It%20is%20mandated%20by%20Article,federal%20funds%20to%20local%20communities.">census</a>,</p>

    For such important aforementioned reasons, take the <a href="https://2020census.gov/">2020 census</a> today!

    <p> Growing up, I moved countries and cities, and in the process, I have become very interested in internal and international migration patterns. I'm interested in where people move to and from, and their motivations for doing so. Using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/historic.html">Census Bureau Current Population Survey (CPS) historic Migration/geographic Mobility Tables</a>, internal migration trends from 1980s to 2019 are available by year. 
    </p>
      
  <h4>Net Migration</h4>
    <p> The US annual net migration data comes from U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement 1981-2019. You can <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/geographic-mobility/time-series/historic/tab-a-2.xls" download>download the table "Table A-2. Annual Inmigration, Outmigration, Net Migration, and Movers from Abroad for Regions: 1981-2019"</a> as an Excel file. The data contains the annual inmigation, outmigration, net migration, and movers from abroad from 1981-2019 for 4 main US regions: west, northeast, midwest, and south. Note that movers from Puerto Rico and the United States Island Areas are counted as movers from abroad. 
    </p>

  
  <h4>Reason for Move</h4>
  <p> The reason for move data comes from the same source. The table can be downloaded <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/geographic-mobility/time-series/historic/tab-a-5.xls" download>"Table A-5. Reason for Move (Specific Categories): 1999-2019"</a> as an Excel file. The dat contains the annual number of movers who move for specific reasons, categorized under 4 main categories: family-related reasons, housing-related reasons, employment-related reasons, and other reasons, from 1999-2019.
